description: The full feature lifecycle for a big fullstack feature across the backend (nasam) and the frontend (nasam-frontend-v2). Full /ux-discovery → a complete design doc (narrative sections + /design-schema, /design-api, /design-components, each agnostically reviewed) → /build-feature → two-agent tests → wire + visual verify → two cross-linked PRs. Iterative and collaborative — the agent does the work, you sign off every gate. Use when (1) user says "/sdlc", (2) a feature is large enough to need a real design doc and days of work, (3) it spans API + UI. For small work, use /adhoc-fullstack-feature instead.

# SDLC

You are a senior product engineer. You own the whole thing — from the customer's problem to the code in production — flat team, no handoffs. The requester thinks with you at every gate; you do the work between them.

The full lifecycle for a big fullstack feature, across two repos.

## Repos

- **Backend:** `Nasam-co/nasam` — NestJS, jest. Branch + PR here.
- **Frontend:** `Nasam-co/nasam-frontend-v2` — React/Vite. Separate branch + PR here.

Two repos → two branches → two PRs, cross-linked. Run each repo's build/lint/test from that repo's root.

**Resolve the checkouts before you start; never assume a path.** Usually one repo is the cwd and its
sibling sits next to it. Confirm both, and say which is which, before touching anything:

```bash
git -C . remote get-url origin                 # which repo am I in?
ls -d ../nasam ../nasam-frontend-v2 2>/dev/null # is the sibling checked out?
```

If the second repo isn't on disk, stop and ask — do not build half the feature and call it done, and
do not clone somewhere arbitrary.

## Skills this depends on

This skill orchestrates other skills. Some are **account skills** (available anywhere); the rest are
**repo skills** in `Nasam-co/nasam/.claude/skills/` or `nasam-frontend-v2/.claude/skills/` and only
resolve when you are in that checkout.

| Skill                                            | Where     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `/ux-discovery`, `/ux-touch`, `/clickup`          | account   |
| `/frontend-build`, `/chrome-verify`               | frontend  |
| `/design-schema`, `/design-api`, `/design-components` | backend |
| `/build-feature`, `/plan-tests`, `/write-tests`   | backend   |
| `/adhoc-feature`, `/adhoc-fullstack-feature`, `/fix-bug` | backend |

If a skill in this list does not load, **say which one and stop at that gate** — do not improvise its
job from this table alone. A missing skill usually means you are in the wrong repo, or the repo's
skills have moved.

## How this runs

- **Collaborative, not autonomous.** Every phase ends at a **gate** — present, think together, get sign-off, then continue. Never blow through a gate on assumption.
- **Load skills, don't just read them.** Invoke the Skill tool and follow it. When you spawn a sub-agent to run one, tell it to load the skill and return proof of work (artifact path, findings, screenshots); re-run it if it skipped.
- **Read at the phase that needs it.** Each skill below pulls its own references when it runs — the engineering standards and design method load with the build and design phases, not up front. Keep discovery clean of implementation thinking.

## Lifecycle

### 1. Discover — full `/ux-discovery`

Load `/ux-discovery` (the full one, not lite): problem framing, ideation, synthesis, design, evaluation → the discovery doc tree in `nasam-frontend-v2/docs/discovery/{feature}/`. Add a cheap HTML preview of the key screens.

→ **GATE (UX):** walk the discovery + preview. Sign-off before any code.

### 2. Frontend demo — `/frontend-build` (demo mode)

Production React, mock data shaped to the UX (`// TODO: Replace with real API`). The feature becomes real to look at before the design is committed.

→ **GATE (Frontend):** sign-off on the demo UI.

### 3. Design doc — `docs/design_docs/{FEATURE}.md`

Follow `docs/design_docs/TEMPLATE.md`, drafted via `DESIGN_DOC_METHOD.md`.

- **Narrative** — Overview, Existing Solution, Use Cases + Business Rules, Alternatives, Open Questions. Port and sharpen from the discovery; don't re-litigate it. → **GATE.**
- **Technical** — each its own skill, each with its own agnostic review + sign-off:
  - `/design-schema`
  - `/design-api`
  - `/design-components`
- **Tail** — Implementation Details, Assumptions/dependencies, Milestone, Glossary. Inline.

→ **GATE (Design doc):** sign-off on the whole doc.

### 4. Plan tests — `/plan-tests` (fresh agent)

From the design doc, not the implementation. Behavior scenarios → `docs/for_ai/test_scenarios_for_ai/{feature}_test_scenarios.md`. Feeds step 6 verify too.

### 5. Build

- **Backend:** load `/build-feature` against the design doc — it runs its own impl plan, build, and review sweep.
- **Frontend:** wire the demo to the real API per the design doc's API section. Adjust types/API where they don't line up.
- Build + lint both, from each repo root.

→ **GATE (Built):** both green.

### 6. Tests + verify

- **Backend:** `/write-tests` (fresh agent B) → `*.e2e.spec.ts` + gap report. `npm test -- --testNamePattern="..."`.
- **Frontend:** `/chrome-verify` (fresh agent) — the test scenarios re-framed as the user's flow(s), at 375px, a screenshot per scenario, surfaced to the requester.

### 7. Review — frontend sweep

The backend was reviewed inside `/build-feature`. Run the `/adhoc-feature` sweep on the **frontend** changes: references (frontend-build/reference) → code-simplifier, then code-reviewer (+ `/fix-bug`) → jsdoc. Each agent returns findings; an empty return means it skipped — re-run it.

### 8. PRs — two, cross-linked

Backend PR in `nasam`, frontend PR in `nasam-frontend-v2`. Each body links the other PR + the design doc + the discovery doc.

Open them with whichever is available in the session:

- **`gh` CLI** (local terminal) — run git + `gh` from each repo root, or `gh -R Nasam-co/<repo>`.
- **GitHub MCP tools** (`mcp__github__create_pull_request`) — on Claude Code web/remote, where `gh`
  is **not** installed. Push the branch with git, then open the PR through the MCP tool.

Cross-linking is a two-pass job: open PR A, open PR B with A's URL, then edit A to link B.

### 9. Log — `/clickup`

One task, or the design doc's Milestone broken into subtasks. Link both PRs + the docs. Status `in review`. Description for non-technical reviewers.

## Output

Report: feature shipped, the discovery doc + design doc, backend + frontend files, tests, both PR URLs, ClickUp task(s).

## CRITICAL Rules

- Every gate is a sign-off. Collaborative, not autonomous — never run the whole lifecycle on assumption.
- Reuse the design method + the three design-section skills for the design doc — don't freehand it.
- Two repos, two PRs — never mix frontend and backend into one repo.
- Load skills and apply them. Fresh agents for plan-tests, write-tests, chrome-verify, and each design-section review.
- No `any`. Deep modules. Match existing patterns; no new ones without discussion.
